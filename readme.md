### Little More About Me  

I love movies ðŸŽ¥, cooking :ramen:, music :saxophone:	and video games :video_game:. I love meeting new people and learning new things, so please feel free to say hello and share a story with me. I'm good at Leadership, Collaboration and Team Building. Currently working as a C++ programmer Intern at [Codespeedy](https://www.codespeedy.com/). Mentored students regarding topics such as technology, management and diversity at [GirlScript](https://www.girlscript.tech/about). The key joke to my young adult life is that if i want to make my parents laugh i tell them about my future plans. I also love giving contsts (Who doesn't love bugs, non-sensical problem statements and Time limit Exceeded verdicts ). I'm currently focusing :dart: of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning(Convolutional Neural Networks) and ofcourse algorithms.

Here's my favourite song for you :trumpet:- [**Feeling Good** by **Nina Simone**.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BNMKGYiJpvg)
